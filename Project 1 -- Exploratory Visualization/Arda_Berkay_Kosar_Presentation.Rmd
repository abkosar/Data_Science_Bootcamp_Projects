# __Part 6__|Conclusions and Further Analysis

## Conclusions

1. Brooklyn and Queens seem to have the highest Total Number of Deaths among the New York City (NYC) Boroughs.

2. Collisions in Brooklyn seem to include more Car - Pedestrian type of collisions. 

3. Evening and Morning accident numbers seem to be higher than the other times of the day.

4. There is an increasing trend in the number of total deaths, to the end of the year and the maximum death number is reached at the end of the Fall and at the beginning of Winter.

## Further Analysis

1. The effecting factors to collisions

2. Vehicle Types

3. Streetwise Analysis
